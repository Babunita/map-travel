# Interactive Travel Map

## Overview
The Interactive Travel Map project is a web application that allows users to visualize a travel route from LPU Manila to Baguio using Leaflet.js. The map includes multiple bus terminal options, displaying essential information such as pricing, safety ratings, and convenience scores. Users can filter bus terminals based on price range and interact with the map to view details about each location.
